## Brief analysis on my favorite spotify playlist in Python

In this project, my aim was to apply one of the supervised machine learning techniques, namely a linear regression. First I ran some descriptive analyses of my favorite songs's features in Spotify. Then, I built the ML model, predicting the danceability level of my favorite songs based on the songs' tempo level. For this anlaysis, I splitted the dataset into a train and a test dataset. The model was trained on the train dataset and validated on the test dataset.
